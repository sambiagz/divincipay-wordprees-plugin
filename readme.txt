DiVinciPay, Crypto payment plugin for Wordpress, accepting ERC20/BEP20 tokens for goods/services.
== Description ==
DiVinciPay is a crypto payment plugin that allows Wordpress websites to accept hundreds of ERC20 and BEP20 tokens as a method of payment for goods and services. Plugin features include:

- NFT Marketing Integration: DiVinciPay stands out as the sole platform providing NFT marketing through airdrops to token wallet holders, significantly boosting merchant exposure.
- Versatile Token Acceptance: DiVinciPay accommodates payments with a broad range of ERC-20 and BEP-20 tokens, accepting between 1 and 10,000 tokens to your checkout
- Cross-Chain Non-Custodial Platform: Built on both the Ethereum and Binance chains, DiVinciPay is a genuine non-custodian payment platform, providing users with enhanced security and control.
- Direct Wallet-to-Wallet Transactions: Enjoy seamless transactions as DiVinciPay facilitates direct transfers from the buyer's wallet to the merchant's wallet, eliminating the need for third-party custodians.
- Exclusive Wen3.5 Integration: As a true Web3.5 application, DiVinciPay integrates exclusively with MetaMask, ensuring a secure and immersive user experience.
- Anti-Phishing Security: DiVinciPay is built as an anti-phishing platform because you are not connecting your website via Web3. DiVinciPay connects directly to the shopping cart, not the wallet.
